Welcome to my first serious project! I’m excited to share this with you, and I’m open to feedback as I continue to learn and grow in my development skills.

1)User Authentication:
  - Users log in using their Google account.
  - Upon successful authentication, a new user is created in the database with a unique ID.

2)Navigation:
  - After logging in, users are redirected to the home page.
  - From the home page, users can navigate to:
    - ToDo List
    - Notes
    - About Me

3)Data Management:
  - ToDo List: Users can add, edit, and remove tasks. These tasks are saved in a separate table in the database, associated with the user's unique ID.
  - Notes: Users can create and manage notes. Notes are saved in a separate table, also linked to the user's unique ID.

Please be kind:
This is my first serious project, and I am eager to improve. Any feedback, suggestions, or constructive criticism is greatly appreciated!
